This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

My project is a simple project. I put a quote on the first page. Then i put a function on the about page that included a profile picture of me. 

## Steps
- Set up Next.js with `npx create-next-app@latest`
- Modified the home page to include a quote
- Added a simple "About" page that return a message and a picture of me under it.
